            <h2 style="font-size: 34px;">What are Stocks?</h2>

            <p style="font-size: 22px; color: #4f4f4f;">Stocks, also known as equities or shares, represent ownership in
                a
                company. When you own a stock, you are essentially buying a piece of that company, which makes you a
                shareholder. The number of shares you own determines the extent of your ownership stake in the company.
                This
                ownership entitles you to a variety of rights and potential benefits, including the following:</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 34px;">Types of Stocks:</h2>

            <h4 style="font-size: 34px;">Common Stocks:</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; color: #4f4f4f;">Common stocks are the most prevalent type of stock. When people
                refer to "buying stocks," they usually mean common stocks. Common shareholders have voting rights in the
                company and may receive dividends, although the amount is typically not fixed.</p>

            <h4 style="font-size: 34px;">Preffered Stocks:</h4>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; color: #4f4f4f;">Preferred stocks, on the other hand, are a different class of
                stock
                that combines characteristics of both stocks and bonds. Preferred shareholders typically have a fixed
                dividend rate, but they may not have voting rights or the potential for capital appreciation as common
                shareholders do.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 34px;">How Stocks are Valued</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; color: #4f4f4f;">Stocks are valued based on a combination of factors, and the
                process
                of determining a stock's value can be complex. The primary methods for valuing stocks include
                fundamental
                analysis and market sentiment. Here's a breakdown of how stocks are valued:</p>

            <ol>
                <li style="font-size: 22px;"><b>Earnings and Profitability:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-size: 22px; color: #4f4f4f;"><b>Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:</b> The P/E ratio
                            is
                            a common valuation metric that compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share
                            (EPS).
                            It provides insight into how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.
                            A
                            high P/E ratio may indicate that investors expect strong future growth, while a low P/E
                            ratio
                            may suggest a less optimistic outlook.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li style="font-size: 22px;"><b>Dividends and Yield:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-size: 22px; color: #4f4f4f;"><b>Dividend Yield:</b> For income-focused
                            investors,
                            the dividend yield is crucial. It's the annual dividend payment divided by the stock's
                            current
                            price. A higher dividend yield may be attractive to those seeking regular income from their
                            investments.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li style="font-size: 22px;"><b>Grwoth Prospects:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-size: 22px; color: #4f4f4f;"><b>Earnings Growth:</b> Investors often assess a
                            company's historical and projected earnings growth. A company with a track record of
                            consistent
                            growth may be considered more valuable.</li>

                        <li style="font-size: 22px; color: #4f4f4f; "><b>Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) Ratio:</b> The
                            PEG
                            ratio factors in a company's growth rate alongside the P/E ratio to provide a more
                            comprehensive
                            view of its valuation. A PEG ratio below 1 is typically considered favorable.</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
            </ol>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <button class="collapsible">What's the most expensive stock of all time?</button>
                <div class="faq">
                    <p>The most expensive publicly-traded share of stock of all time were the Class A shares of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), Warren Buffet’s conglomerate and holding company as of January 2022. They hit $487,675 per share on Jan 18, 2022.
                        1
                         It’s important to remember that this does not mean it is the most valuable company by stock value. The value of a company’s stock, or “market capitalization,” is determined by multiplying the price of its shares by the number of its shares.</p>

                    <p>Unrealized gains or losses represent the amount you would gain or lose if you sold your investment, often a stock, at its current value. You “realize” these gains or losses when you actually sell the investment.</p>
